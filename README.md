# kendoui-bridge-next

We are planning the next bridge based on the more aurelia friendly KendoUI SDK, roughly defined as a product of the collaboration between Telerik's and Aurelia-UI-Toolkits team. This initial work is focused on identifying the list of missing API points and options that can be changed (by Telerik's team) to aid with the two-way binding, templating and other improvements for the implementation of the Aurelia bridge.

This repository should be viewed as the container of all issues we plan to identify and properly document - to be used as the "input" for Telerik's team as well as subsequent design discusssions. The created set of documents (in the form of issues or the associated wiki articles), will later be used as the technical documentation for Aurelia-UI-Toolkit team for the future Aurelia-KendoUI-Bridge 2.0 

The very first task in this project is to create a well documented and structured **[collection of existing and newly discovered issues](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/kendoui-bridge-next/issues/1)** that are candidates for the remedy we expect to get from the Telerik's developers.
